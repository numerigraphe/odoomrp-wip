This module performs the following:

    1.- Created two new fields in the test template line:

        1.1.- Validity Start Date, required.
        1.2.- Validity End Date.

Before creating a new object in test template line, it will validate that
there is no previous line without Validity End Date, for the new test
template line you want to create.

date on which this object is created, is between the new dates of the
Test Template Line.
